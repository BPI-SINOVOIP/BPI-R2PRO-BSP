/*! \page cgicc_bugs Reporting Bugs

If you think you have found a bug in %cgicc, then you should send as
complete a report as possible to <tt>bug-cgicc@gnu.org</tt>.
Ideally, you should include the text you get by running
\c config.guess and the text you see when you run
\c configure.  This can be accomplished in the
<tt>%cgicc-$(VERSION)/</tt> directory with the following commands:

\htmlonly
<div class="unix"><pre>
% support/config.guess > out
% ./configure >> out
% mail -s "cgicc bug?" bug-cgicc@gnu.org < out
</pre></div>
\endhtmlonly

If you think you have tracked down the source of the bug, please
also send a patch made with 
\htmlonly
<div class="unix"><pre>
% diff -U 5
</pre></div>
\endhtmlonly
which fixes the problem.
