README for cgicc-example
========================

This directory contains skeleton code and supporting autoconf/automake
infrastructure for a CGI application using cgicc.

Assuming that you did a 
 % ./configure
 % make
 % make install
in the top-level cgicc directory and got a working library, you should
be able to do the same here and get a working executable:
 % ./configure
 % make

If you installed cgicc in a non-default place (by specifying the
--prefix option), you'll need to tell configure where the library is
using the --with-cgicc option, passing the same value:
 % ./configure --with-cgicc=PREFIX
 % make

The 'make install' target is available, but isn't necessary since this
example doesn't do anything.
